Define the contact form recipient for each page, post or custom post type individually

== Description ==
The plugin will display a new filed (\"CF7 Custom Recipient\") in the editing screen of your posts, pages or custom post types.

If you define a custom recipient for any page or post, the Contact Form embedded in that page/post will be sent to that email address.

This is useful when you want to re-use the same contact form and only change the recipient (for instance, if your website is a business directory).

== Installation ==
1. Upload the \'wpcf7-custom-recipient\' folder to the \'/wp-content/plugins/\' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.

You will find a new field (\"CF7 Custom Recipient\") in your post/page editing screen.
